# Python Generator - Task 0

This task sets up a MySQL database called `ALX_prodev` and seeds it with sample user data from `user_data.csv`. It creates the `user_data` table and inserts rows only if they don't already exist.

## Files

- `seed.py`: Contains functions to connect, create database, create table, and insert data.
- `user_data.csv`: CSV file with sample data (already provided in the project).
